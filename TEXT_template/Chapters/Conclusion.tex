\lettrine[lines=4]{\textcolor{purple}{T}}{his} chapter summarizes the conclusion of our work, thesis presented \dSymb, a novel approach, and supporting tool, to overcome the limitation that complex Spark applications embed a single execution. The preliminary evaluation shows that \tool misses fewer deadlines and allocate resources more efficiently than \cSpark. As for future work, we plan to optimize the profiling phase by using a branch-based selection criterion, instead of the simple path-based solution adopted in this paper.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This thesis presented \dSymb, a novel approach, and supporting tool, to overcome the limitation that complex Spark applications embed a single execution. The preliminary evaluation shows that \tool misses fewer deadlines and allocate resources more efficiently than \cSpark. 

\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future_work}
As for future work, we plan to optimize the profiling phase by using a branch-based selection criterion, instead of the simple path-based solution adopted in this paper.
